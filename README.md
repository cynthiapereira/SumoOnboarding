# SumoOnboarding

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

This is a widget that is meant to display custom content based on the custom page that you display. You need a Lithium instance and access to Custom components for this freemarker  weidget to work. 
With a copy the project, fill in the html with the steps and the names of the custom pages. 

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

1. Lithium Instance
2. Access to Studio
3. Create custom pages and remember their names
4. Knowledge of Freemarker and basic HTML and CSS
```
Give examples
```
<#if expression>

<#else/>
  <div class="classname">
  </div>

</#if>

## Running the tests

There are no automated tests, publishing and testing your links are the best way to check to make sure that the page detected shows the correct content. 

Test the widget to make sure: 
1. You do not have duplicated content. Look for comments between if statements and look for html comments that might be comenting out freemarker
2. Test your html seperate from the freemarker 
3. Make sure that CSS is not the same name as style from the Lithium Skinn

## Deployment

You will need 3 custom pages
And you will need to create 3 custom components

In this repo there are three html files with the names and mark up in each component. The each can be added to a custom page by their name on the quilt you have selected for your custom page. 

###How to edit a Custom Component
#Go to the page name
#Look up the component name
#Click on components
#Edit the component name that you found from the page name
#Click save
#Preview 
#Change accordingly 
#If you need to publish (note the time you made the change for queued studio version)
